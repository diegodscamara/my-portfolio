        Hey there! I’m a Front End Developer with a passion for creating user-friendly interfaces. With experience in ReactJS, NextJS, KnockoutJS, and more, I’m always exploring new technologies to stay ahead of the curve. My design skills extend beyond coding, as I’m proficient in Figma and Adobe XD to bring my visions to life.

        I’ve worked with various frameworks such as Styled Components, TailwindCSS, Chakra UI, Sass, Less, Bootstrap, Wordpress, and Elementor, allowing me to quickly adapt to project requirements. From integrating frontend systems with CMS to working with GraphQL and REST APIs, I’m always eager to learn and take on new challenges.

        Being skilled in Scrum, Kanban, and Agile, I’ve contributed to analysis and planning meetings, ensuring seamless collaboration with my team.
